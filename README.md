# Course project (data structure)
Implemented a min heap in C++ with heap sort, along with code to solve the k-th minimum difference problem

Test cases and measurements of the average time for running heap sort are also included

## Files


    exec.py            # A Python file from instructor that contains code to solve the k-th minimum difference problem,
                         intended for checking the correctness of the implementation
    heap.cpp           # Source code for the project
    README.md          # Description of the project and how to use it


## How to use?
